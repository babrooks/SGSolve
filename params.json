{"name":"SGSolve","tagline":"Tools for solving stochastic games.","body":"### Overview\r\nThis is the GitHub project site for the SGSolve package of tools for solving for the pure strategy subgame perfect Nash equilibria of two player stochastic games with perfect monitoring and public randomization. The package consists of a library for representing and solving stochastic games, as well as a Qt based graphical interface to the library called SGViewer. SGSolve implements the algorithm for solving stochastic games that is described in Abreu, Brooks, and Sannikov (2016), which can be found [here](http://www.benjaminbrooks.net/research.shtml). SGSolve is released under the terms of the [GPLv3 license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nThe package was written by Ben Brooks. You can find Ben's contact information on his [homepage](http://www.benjaminbrooks.net).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
